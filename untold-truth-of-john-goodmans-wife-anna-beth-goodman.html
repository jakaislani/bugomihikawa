She is a businesswoman who might be known best for being the wife of John Goodman, a famous American actor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-education></span>Early life and education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna hasn’t shared any details regarding her siblings or parents with the public but it is known that she was raised in Bogalusa in a middle-class family.</p><p>She became interested in acting at a very early age as most of her peers dreamed about becoming either actresses or models – Anna went on to test her skills at the school’s drama club but soon found out she wasn’t talented enough for acting.</p><p>She attended Bogalusa High School from which she matriculated in 1986 having skipped a year and then enrolled at the University of New Orleans from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1989.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=annas-career></span>Anna’s career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Upon graduation, Anna moved to Los Angeles in California to live with her husband and there started working in the fashion industry – she came back to Louisiana after the birth of her daughter in August 1990 and in New Orleans’ French Quarter opened a children’s clothing store, having done a lot of research, and realising that New Orleans didn’t have a shop that sold European clothes for kids – the store is called Pippen Lane, and today sells other things besides clothes such as toys, gifts and strollers.</p><p>In 2011 Anna bought Lylian Heirloom, a clothing brand, and has been working with it to this day. Most recently, Anna created her signature label called “Layette”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=love-life-and-marriage-with-john-goodman></span>Love life and marriage with John Goodman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna and John Goodman met in 1987 – some sources claim it was 1988 – at a Halloween party at which they were introduced by a mutual friend – Anna was attending her second year of studies at the time, while John was shooting for his film “Everybody’s All-American”. They dated for two years before marrying in a private ceremony attended by their closest friends and family in 1989 and on 31 August 1990, the two welcomed their daughter Molly Evangeline Goodman – the family then moved away from Los Angeles and Hollywood as Anna and John wanted to raise their daughter away from the media’s attention.</p><p>According to John, Anna has stayed by his side during the toughest of times, as she helped him fight his alcohol addiction and undergo therapy – she also helped him lose weight as the two worked out together at a gym.</p><p>Anna hasn’t talked about any other men she might have dated, and as of November 2020, she is married to John Goodman and has a daughter with him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hobbies-and-other-interests></span>Hobbies and other interests<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna was quite sporting during her teenage years, as she played various sports including soccer and also worked out at a gym several times each week – she continued to work out during her 20s but eventually stopped.</p><p>Travelling is one of her main hobbies, and Anna has been all around the US, mostly to keep her husband company during his film events, but also for her own career.</p><p>She has travelled for pleasure as well, and has been to various European countries such as France, Italy and Greece.</p><p>Anna is a lover of animals, with zebras being her favorites, and she supports the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).</p><p>She is keen on watching movies in her spare time – her favorite actor and actress are Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep, while a couple of her favorite movies are “The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”, “Bruce Almighty” and “Kramer vs. Kramer”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-height-and-net-worth></span>Age, height and net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna is 51 years old.

One of the roles which helped him become a famous actor he is today was in the 1986 satirical comedy movie “True Stories”. He worked with the Coen Brothers for the first time in 1987 when he starred in their crime comedy film “Raising Arizona” while the following years saw him appear in more of their movies, including “Barton Fink” in 1991, “The Big Lebowski” in 1998 and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” in 2000 – John has also appeared in three Steven Spielberg’s films “Always”, “The Flintstones” and “Arachnophobia”.</p><p>For his performance in the comedy series “Studio 60 on the Sunset Trip”, John won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Drama Series.
