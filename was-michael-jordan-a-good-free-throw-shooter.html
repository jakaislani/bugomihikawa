Meanwhile, the Bruins were 88â€“2 with Abdul-Jabbar on campus. They won the first three of their record seven straight national championships. However, a ban on dunking imposed in 1966 forced the big man to get creative with his offensive repertoire.<h2>Why did the NCAA ban dunking?</h2>Some of that tension was transferred into NCAA rules meant to penalize Alcindor, then a dominant Black player for the UCLA Bruins who led his team to a crushing victory in the NCAA Tournament â€” just two days after the tournament concluded, the NCAA made the dunk illegal.<h2>Was MJ a good 3-point shooter?</h2>Shortened Basket Seasons (1995-1997)<p>From 1995 to 1997 (including playoffs), Michael Jordan made 287 of 748 three pointers and he shot 38.4 percent from 3-point range.
