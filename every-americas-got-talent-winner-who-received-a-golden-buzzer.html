Unlike other popular competition series such as The X Factor, The Voice, or American Idol, which focus exclusively on singing, Got Talent is for everyone; the only requirement is that participants possess some type of ability. Since its debut in 2006, the show has allowed people from all over the U.S. and the world to display their talents, be that magic, ventriloquism, dance, stand-up comedy, or stunt performance.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=639 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>Of course, in order to make it to the live shows, contestants must first impress the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">panel of judges</a>, who get to decide by vote who makes the cut. On special occasions, though, contests may get an extra boost — the Golden Buzzer. In season nine, this key element was added to the mix, allowing a judge to save an act from elimination. Soon after, hitting the buzzer started giving the one who pressed it the power to send an act straight to the live shows, something that was later expanded to allow the hosts the same ability. Ever since, the Golden Buzzer has become a permanent fixture in America’s Got Talent and its spin-offs.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Over the years, plenty of extraordinary acts have gotten the coveted buzzer, which is incredible in and of itself but doesn’t guarantee victory. Until now, only eight Golden Buzzer contestants across America’s Got Talent have taken home the big prize, so let’s remember them.</p><h2 id=h-paul-zerdin-2015 data-injectable=false>Paul Zerdin — 2015</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Season 10 of America’s Got Talent was the very first to give a contestant a boost that led to him coming out as the winner. Paul Zerdin presented the judges with a comedic ventriloquism act and while that impressed the regular panel of judges at the time, it wasn’t enough to convince them to hit the much-desired button. The one to grant Zerdin the Golden Buzzer ended up being guest judge Marlon Wayans during the Judge Cuts round, after expressing the child-like joy he felt watching the performance. Marlon wished everyone else could experience the same joy, and that they did.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Grace VanderWaal — 2016</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>The following year, season 11 debuted, introducing all the show’s viewers to Grace VanderWaal. The 12-year-old enchanted the audition room by singing an original track while accompanying herself on the ukelele, which earned her a standing ovation. It’s not every day that such talented young contestants walk the America’s Got Talent stage, so the judges’ amazement is understandable. Howie Mandel promptly pressed the Golden Buzzer, sending the singer straight to the live shows and kickstarting her path to eventual victory.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Darci Lynne Farmer&nbsp;— 2017</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=897 data-injectable=true>Much like in the previous year, America’s Got Talent season 12 was won by a 12-year-old, Darci Lynne Farmer. The talented young girl decided to participate in the contest as a way to keep ventriloquism alive, and while doing so, she thoroughly wowed the judges with her performance — accompanied by her puppet, Petunia, of course. Not only can Farmer make it look like her puppets are talking, but she can also have them sing incredibly well, and she made sure to showcase both talents in her audition. This earned her the Golden Buzzer from Mel B, and later, the season’s big prize.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kodi Lee — 2019</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=869 data-injectable=true>In 2019, Kodi Lee took the America’s Got Talent stage by storm with his cover of “A Song For You” by Leon Russell. What makes this feat even more impressive to the audience, was Lee’s story, as told by his mother. He is a blind young man on the Autism Spectrum who has pursued his passion for singing and piano playing since childhood. After moving the judges and crowd with his performance, Lee got the Golden Buzzer from Gabrielle Union, who wished to give the contestant and his mother something special in return for this season 14 audition.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>V. Unbeatable — 2020</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=891 data-injectable=true>America’s Got Talent: The Champions debuted in 2019, but it wasn’t until 2020, with the show’s second season, that we got a Golden Buzzer winner. The Indian dance crew known as V. Unbeatable became known to viewers during season 14 of America’s Got Talent, and while the performers also earned a Golden Buzzer back then, it wasn’t enough to win. Coming back stronger for The Champions, the V. Unbeatable crew blew the audience’s socks off with their acrobatic dance audition and, in particular, Howie Mandel, who gave them the well-deserved Golden Buzzer.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brandon Leake — 2020</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=874 data-injectable=true>It took 15 seasons for a spoken word artist to make their way into America’s Got Talent, but this was well worth the wait. Brandon Leake paid tribute to his late sister by performing an original poem and his way with words filled the judges’ hearts with emotion. It was only natural, then, for Howie Mandel to be moved to action, hitting the Golden Buzzer that propelled Leake onward in the competition. This audition was only the beginning, though, and after impressing the judges, the poet touched an entire country, which secured his victory at the end of the season.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Alfredo Silva’s Cage Riders — 2022</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=696 data-current-count=996 data-injectable=true>Alfredo Silva’s Cage Riders were the winners of the first — and so far, the only — season of America’s Got Talent: Extreme. In a spin-off show solely dedicated to extreme and adrenaline-inducing talents, it’s easy to see why this stunt team got a Golden Buzzer. Seeing others risk their health, and quite possibly their lives, to perform motorcycle stunts in a cage isn’t for everyone, however, the level of stress this audition provoked on the panel of judges and the show’s host eventually paid off. Alfredo Silva’s Kiss of Death thoroughly impressed Terry Crews, who wasted little time in hitting the Golden Buzzer that led them straight to the finals.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Mayyas — 2022</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>In season 17 Mayyas stepped on the stage of America’s Got Talent with something to prove. Fueled by its members’ desire to display their talent to the world, the Lebanese group showed off its hypnotizing moves during an almost three-minute-long performance. Although no one watching was indifferent to Mayyas’ dancing, Sofía Vergara was particularly touched by it, praising the group’s creative and beautiful choreography. To further aid their quest for success, the judge pressed the Golden Buzzer, sending the performers to the live shows. At the end of the season, Mayyas came out victorious.</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>Season 18 of America’s Got Talent is currently underway, and fans can watch all the magic happen on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymwsSrsGaZnZq%2Fqq%2FArGSgp6RiwaK4xKerZq%2BZo7umvoywn6hlopqwprXVnptmmV2cvK2wxKdkm62qr7Kzew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-americas-got-talent-winner-who-received-a-golden-buzzer.html&text=Every%20Americas%20Got%20Talent%20winner%20who%20received%20a%20Golden%20Buzzer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-americas-got-talent-winner-who-received-a-golden-buzzer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-americas-got-talent-winner-who-received-a-golden-buzzer.html&title=Every%20Americas%20Got%20Talent%20winner%20who%20received%20a%20Golden%20Buzzer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-americas-got-talent-winner-who-received-a-golden-buzzer.html&title=Every%20Americas%20Got%20Talent%20winner%20who%20received%20a%20Golden%20Buzzer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-americas-got-talent-winner-who-received-a-golden-buzzer.html&title=Every%20Americas%20Got%20Talent%20winner%20who%20received%20a%20Golden%20Buzzer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-americas-got-talent-winner-who-received-a-golden-buzzer.html&description=Every%20Americas%20Got%20Talent%20winner%20who%20received%20a%20Golden%20Buzzer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-jason-leigh-net-worth-details-about-age-movies-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Jason Leigh Net Worth: Details About Age, Movies, Husband - SarkariResult">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rihanna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rihanna  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
