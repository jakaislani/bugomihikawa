Others wait until the autumnal equinox to start hauling out the Halloween decorations. For us, fall starts when Trader Joe’s fall items start rolling out. So, officially, fall is upon us. Everyone’s favorite purveyor of pumpkin and pumpkin spice products just announced its <a href=# rel=noopener>full lineup</a> of fall products and, baby, it’s a doozy. They’ve got cinnamon brooms! Spatchcocked chickens (I just wanted to say “spatchcocked”)! Those butternut squash mac & cheese bites people seem to like so well! There’s a lot going on, but for the purposes of this article, we’re focusing on new and returning Trader Joe’s pumpkin and Trader Joe’s pumpkin spice products—and only the edible ones (don’t worry, they have pumpkin body butter, hand soap, and candles, too). From Trader Joe’s pumpkin bread and bagels to Trader Joe’s pumpkin ice cream and cookies, here’s what to keep an eye out for.</p><strong>Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Mix</strong><p>If you like to bake but don’t actually want to bake things from scratch, Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Mix is a perennial favorite. Just add eggs, oil, and water and—voila—your kitchen is a Martha Stewart-esque fall wonderland.</p><strong>Pumpkin Cranberry Crisps</strong><p>If you like Raincoast Crisps or TJ’s own Raisin Rosemary Crisps Fig & Olive Crisps, you’ll like these crunchy little <a href=#>crackers</a>. They’re packed with nuts and dried fruit and are perfect for dipping (they recommend dipping them in the Pumpkin Cream Cheese) or crumbling into a creamy butternut squash soup.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Ice Cream</strong><p>Ice cream made with pumpkin puree? Sure, why not! It’s fall and YOU MUST EAT GOURDS AT EVERY MEAL.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Hold the Cone!</strong><p>Okay, these look kind of amazing. Pumpkin ice cream in a gingery cone with an itty-bitty ginger cone with a creamy white confectionary shell? Sign us up.</p><strong>Non-Dairy Pumpkin Oat Beverage</strong><p>This product seems perfect for people who don’t like coffee but still want a PSL experience. It’s oat milk with pumpkin puree, pumpkin spice, sugar, and a little salt for balance. And, hey, if you do like coffee, you can add a splash of this to your morning cup (they also recommend trying it in a smoothie or with pumpkin spice cereal).</p><strong>Pumpkin Bisque</strong><p>You’ll find a couple of pumpkin-y bisques at TJ’s this season. This one comes in a jar, is shelf stable, and, if Trader Joe’s is to be believed, is “thick and rich and creamy and exceptionally flavorful.” Look for it in the soup section.</p><strong>Pumpkin Butternut Squash Bisque</strong><p>You’ll find this version of TJ’s pumpkin bisque with the refrigerated, ready-to-eat items. It’s finished with brown butter and sage, which sounds delish. All you have to do is heat it up.&nbsp;</p><strong>Apple & Pumpkin Hand Pies</strong><p>These are like the upgraded, fall-friendly version of Hostess hand pies. They’re buttery and rich and you get two of them for about four bucks—no wonder they’re a seasonal fan fave.</p><strong>Pumpkin Spice Coffee</strong><p>Pumpkin spice coffee is the reason for the season. Naturally, Trader Joe’s makes a very beloved one (it’s <a href=#>Josh Scherer’s favorite fall coffee</a>). Stock up on these canisters of grounds if you want cinnamon and nutmeg in your coffee all year long.</p><strong>Mini Pumpkin Ginger Scones</strong><p>You need something to go with the pumpkin spice coffee, right? These scones are sold by the dozen in the frozen section. No prep needed—just unbox them and pop ‘em in the oven. Next stop, scone city.</p><strong>Pumpkin Tortilla Chips</strong><p>Chips and salsa but make it fall. (Really, tho, Trader Joe’s, where’s the pumpkin salsa or the pumpkin hummus for dipping??)</p><strong>Gluten Free Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Mix</strong><p>TJ’s claims that if you didn’t know this bread and muffin mix was gluten free, you wouldn’t know it was gluten free. Hey, GF folks, try it and let us know if that’s true. (Update: A helpful reader reports that this bread mix is, in fact, so good that you wouldn’t know it’s gluten free!)</p><strong>Pumpkin Spice Rooibos</strong><p>Even if you don’t love the pumpkin spice flavor profile, you have to admit it pairs well with a nice, spicy tea. This is so warming—and it comes in a really cute tin.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Cream Cheese Spread</strong><p>When Trader Joe’s fall items start rolling out, this is one you’re bound to hear about people searching for. A fan fave, for sure. Don’t forget the pumpkin bagels to go with (yes, there are pumpkin bagels on this list, too).&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Biscotti</strong><p>If ready-to-bake scones aren’t your style (hey, effort is effort), these pumpkin spice biscotti will pair nicely with your PSLs. They look sort of dry and dull, but fans swear by them.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Joe-Joe’s</strong><p>If there’s one thing we can rely on as the seasons change, it’s new flavors of Joe-Joe’s, Trader Joe’s Oreos dupe. There are actually two varieties of pumpkin Joe-Joe’s heading to shelves this fall. The other ones are dipped in a pumpkin spice coating—pick your cookie pumpkin poison.</p><strong>Petite Pumpkin Spice Cookies</strong><p>If you like dipped animal crackers, you’ll like these. They’re crunchy little shortbread cookies dunked in a yogurt coating and covered in nonpareils for even more crunch. Not great for dunking in milk, but great for fall vibes.</p><strong>Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur</strong><p>We recently taste tested a <a href=#>creamy liqueur made to taste like brunch</a> and it was so good, I have creamy liqueur on the brain now. Spiking some coffee with this seems like an awfully good idea right about now.</p><strong>Pumpkin Overnight Oats</strong><p>If you like your oatmeal cold and ready to eat (a lot of people do, apparently), try this. It’s made with date paste instead of sugar, plus a little salt so it’s not just sweet, sweet, sweet.</p><strong>This Pumpkin Walks Into a Bar</strong><p>Trader Joe’s makes a good cereal bar. Naturally, they make a pumpkin one, too.</p><strong>Pecan Pumpkin Oatmeal</strong><p>Like your oatmeal hot and (almost) ready to eat? Then opt for this instant oatmeal instead of the overnight oats. Pecans give it a little bit of texture, which is nice.</p><strong>Pumpkin Brioche Twist</strong><p>This light, buttery loaf of brioche has a swirl of pumpkin spice. Perfect for French toast.</p><strong>O&H Bakery Pumpkin Kringle</strong><p>This O-shaped loaf is a fall favorite at TJ’s. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to Popsugar</a>, it has a croissant-like texture. It’s the perfect thing to bring to a party or brunch.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Spiced Pumpkin Seeds</strong><p>Trader Joe’s nut aisle always rules, and these are a great fall addition. They’re sweet and savory and a perfect snack when you need a little protein instead of empty calories.</p><strong>Pumpkin Cheesecake</strong><p>Pumpkin pie, but make it cream-cheesy. TJ’s recommends serving this with a scoop of their pumpkin ice cream, and who are we to argue?&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Greek Nonfat Yogurt</strong><p>Hey look, it’s pumpkin pie in a cup. And you can eat it for breakfast.</p><strong>Pumpkin O’s</strong><p>Pumpkin spice cereal is a fall tradition, but this one is actually made with pumpkin—along with oats, obviously. Pair it with the pumpkin oat beverage if you want a fall breakfast that goes hard.</p><strong>Pumpkin Waffles</strong><p>These <a href=#>frozen waffles</a> are headed back to stores. In the past, reviewers have complained that they aren’t pumpkin-y enough, but that might be for the best, right? If you need more pumpkin, top them with pumpkin ice cream or a smear of pumpkin cream cheese.</p><strong>Spicy Pumpkin Samosas</strong><p>We love TJ’s frozen samosas (they’re among our favorite <a href=#>Trader Joe’s frozen apps</a>), and these sound real, real good. In addition to spiced pumpkin, they’re filled with paneer cheese. Yum.</p><strong>Pumpkin Butter</strong><p>This isn’t butter like butter. This is butter like <a href=#>apple butter</a>. It has pumpkin and spices and plenty of sugar so you can smear it on toast (with some actual butter, of course).</p><strong>Spiced Pumpkin Madeleine Cookies</strong><p>The soft, spongy cookies Proust loved with a kick of pumpkin spice. Perf for dunking in the pumpkin spice rooibos tea.</p><strong>Pumpkin Pancake & Waffle Mix</strong><p>I’ve never made pancakes from scratch because <a href=#>pancake mix</a> is just so good and easy. Sadly, this isn’t a just-add-water mix, but if you have eggs, butter, and milk on hand, homemade pancakes (or waffles) are just minutes away.</p><strong>Gluten Free Pumpkin & Pancake Mix</strong><p>Trader Joe’s is pretty good about not leaving out the GF gang.</p><strong>Organic Pumpkin Spice Granola Bark</strong><p>To this point there’s been a woeful lack of chocolate in the lineup of Trader Joe’s fall items. Welp, here ya go. Crunchy granola bark bursting with pepitas with a layer of dark chocolate.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Chocolate Chunk Oatmeal Cookie Mix</strong><p>Hey look, more chocolate. All you do is add butter, water, and egg to this mix and then bake at 350. Baking is a great fall activity, especially when it’s super low effort.</p><strong>Pumpkin Bagels</strong><p>These bagels are made with pumpkin flour, which I did not know was a thing until this very moment. They’re subtly sweet and a little spicy and we assume they pair well with TJ’s pumpkin cream cheese.</p><strong>Gluten Free Pumpkin Spice Bagels</strong><p>Again, the GF gang gets their counterpart. And it’s worth noting that we’ve liked a handful of TJ’s GF baked goods in the past.</p><strong>&nbsp;Pumpkin Cheesecake Croissants</strong><p>Okay, these croissants aren’t croissant shaped, but they look insane all the same. They’re little squares of flaky butter dough with a circular inset of pumpkin cheesecake filling. They come frozen, but you don’t have to proof them like you do <a href=#>Trader Joe’s chocolate croissants</a>.</p><strong>Pumpkin Sticky Toffee Cakes</strong><p>These little cakes look INSANE. They come frozen (two in a pack), and you just pop ‘em in the microwave for about a minute for a gooey treat.&nbsp;</p><strong>Honey Roasted Pumpkin Ravioli</strong><p>Sweet and savory collide in these little pasta pouches. They’re stuffed with brown sugar-spiked pumpkin as well as ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. Toss these with some brown butter and toasted sage and that’s dinner, baby.</p><strong>Gluten Free Pumpkin Ravioli</strong><p>Gluten free ravioli can be really good when it’s done well (some of our <a href=#>all-time favorite cheese ravioli</a> just happen to be GF), so we have high hopes for these.</p><strong>Pumpkin Spiced Teeny Tiny Pretzels</strong><p>If you want one pumpkin spice snack that’s actually a few pumpkin spice snacks, this is a good ‘un. They’re mini pretzels dipped in a pumpkin spice yogurt coating and then rolled in TJ’s own pumpkin spice pumpkin seeds.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Spice Batons</strong><p>People love TJ’s batons, so it’s no surprise that they have a fall-centric version. These rolled wafer cookies filled with a pumpkin spice cream are perf for bringing to a party or potluck when you don’t want to bring wine again.</p><strong>Pumpkin Spiced Joe-Joe’s</strong><p>We already covered the regular Pumpkin Joe-Joe’s, but these are the ones that are dipped in a pumpkin spice coating. If you really like sweet stuff, you’ll probably like these.</p><strong>Pumpkin Blondie Brownies</strong><p>Are they blondies or brownies? According to the description, they’re pumpkin-forward and more like blondies than brownies by virtue of containing white chocolate chips. If the lack of chocolate doesn’t harsh your mellow, these sure sound good.</p><strong>Gluten Free Pumpkin Streusel Muffins</strong><p>These tasty pumpkin muffins are made with rice flour so they’re gluten free. Plus, they’re topped with streusel, and you can’t deny the power of streusel.&nbsp;</p><strong>Pumpkin Gnocchi</strong><p>Pillowy potato pasta spiked with pumpkin? We’re in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKyilrGmvoyjpp6rXaXCrrzKoqVmqKKksbav06xm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftrader-joes-pumpkin-products.html&text=Every%20Pumpkin%20and%20Pumpkin%20Spice%20Product%20Coming%20to%20Trader%20Joes%20This%20Year&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrader-joes-pumpkin-products.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrader-joes-pumpkin-products.html&title=Every%20Pumpkin%20and%20Pumpkin%20Spice%20Product%20Coming%20to%20Trader%20Joes%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftrader-joes-pumpkin-products.html&title=Every%20Pumpkin%20and%20Pumpkin%20Spice%20Product%20Coming%20to%20Trader%20Joes%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftrader-joes-pumpkin-products.html&title=Every%20Pumpkin%20and%20Pumpkin%20Spice%20Product%20Coming%20to%20Trader%20Joes%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrader-joes-pumpkin-products.html&description=Every%20Pumpkin%20and%20Pumpkin%20Spice%20Product%20Coming%20to%20Trader%20Joes%20This%20Year" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./isabelle-allen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Isabelle Allen">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-beatles-dear-prudence-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Beatles  Dear Prudence Lyrics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
