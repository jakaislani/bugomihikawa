The truth about mass communication is that it is a very wide course and its beyond journalism, even though that is the major course in this field where most people build successful careers in.</p><p>As one who studied it, I can honestly tell you that studying any of the courses under mass communication is good and there are jobs in the media especially if you are fresher from the university with a Mass Communication degree. The only sad news is that most of these jobs, though fun can be demanding with low salary as payout depending on your level in whatever media establishment you find yourself.</p><p>For example, if you get a job as a Journalists in a print media house, you must have probably studied Journalism and mass media as a core course in mass communication. Well, the truth about this is that being a mass communication professional requires that you undertake any of its core courses to earn a degree or certificate that qualifies you to work in any organization or media firm that requires such.</p><p>If you want to know how much the salary of mass communicator professionals is or the jobs that exists after studying any of mass communication courses, you shall find the answers in this write-up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mass-communication-salary-in-nigeria></span><strong>Mass Communication Salary in Nigeria </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Professionals in the field of mass communication are known to earn higher salaries due to their many years of experience. This is in contrast to those who just want to start a career in the field. An editor salary for example in one of the private newspaper publishing companies in the country is estimated at N300,000 to N400,000 per month minus bonuses while a graduate who starts as a reporter earns N50,000 to N120,000 depending on the media firm.</p><p>While these figures above might be seen as a discouragement to some, it shows that only professionals in the job enjoy bonuses as opposed to starters.

The only pitfall in this category is that the take home pay in this field is too low when you put it side by side with other professions.</p><p>For instance, entry level journalists in The Sun Newspapers who starts as reporters earn about N50,000 while if you work at The Punch Newspaper as a reporter, you earn N150,000 plus other benefits. While both media houses are owned by private individuals, one pays higher than the other. Government owned media firms pay entry level staff from N90,000 to N120,000 depending on grade and years of experience. Although, subject to increment as you rise in level.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=industries-business></span><strong>Industries & Business</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Vacancies and jobs under this category include research analysts, media consultants, information and marketing analysts and so on.

For those experienced in this aspect, the salary scale should be between N250,000 to N400,000 depending if its on contractual basis or if you are a full staff. Normally, retired editors or lecturers are those who get this kind of mass communication jobs in Nigeria.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=education-sector></span><strong>Education sector<br></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After getting your degree in mass communication, you can choose to work as a professional in the education sector.

Depending on the job description in this sector, some educational institutes pay less than N50,000 while some private universities pay higher salaries than the figures above.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=public-relations-specialistadvertising></span><strong>Public Relations Specialist/Advertising </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This is one of high paying jobs in mass communication. For those who wish to enroll as PR specialists, media specialists or managers, publicity directors, social media experts or even graphic designers for advert agencies, the salaries here are mouth watering.</p><p>Professionals here mostly work on contract basis and earn as high as N100,000 to N250,000 for creating ads, writing press release, building social media presence online for organizations, etc.</p><h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Being an expert in the field of mass communication require diligence and hard work if you must build a solid career base.
