Because of this,&nbsp;Swati Goel proposed the idea of voting for Zach at tribal council for costing the Ika tribe the win, a plan which ultimately prevailed as successful.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Taking one last attempt at securing his safety, Zach forfeited his vote and used his&nbsp;Shot in the Dark&nbsp;die at&nbsp;tribal council. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful, ultimately making history as the first player voted out unanimously (with the exception of Jeff Varner‚Äôs self-elimination in Survivor: Game Changers), leaving the game in a 5-0 vote.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, Zach dished about his decision to use his Shot in the Dark die that fateful night.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been watching this show for so long, and even though I did really connect with all my tribemates really well, it wasn‚Äôt like a social issue or anything. I was just not getting the confirmation from people that I needed‚Ä¶ I got that a little bit from Romeo, but really not from the other people.

That couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. I am a hustler. I‚Äôve worked hard for my grades, my scores, and my competitive success. I wanted to go to a top-tier school, so I worked hard to get in. I have worked hard for what I have, and I‚Äôm proud of it‚Ä¶ In speech and debate, I competed against hundreds of students from around the country every weekend.

Most people avoided it. Meanwhile, I probably stepped on that thing a thousand times over the last four years, trying desperately to will Survivor into my life (and as a result, delay my graduation). Somehow it actually worked, and thanks to my stint in Fiji I‚Äôm still a solid 15 credits away from my degree‚Ä¶ Even though I‚Äôm not leaving WashU this year, so many of the people who‚Äôve made this place so special to me are, so it still feels like the end, even if I still have a little bit left to go.
