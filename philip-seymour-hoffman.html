He was also successful in theater, winning three Tony Award nominations for True West, Long Day's Journey into Night and Death of a Salesman. Hoffman died of acute mixed drug intoxication in New York City on February 2, 2014, at age 46.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Philip Seymour Hoffman was born on July 23, 1967, in Rochester, New York, the second of four children. His father worked for Xerox and his mother was a lawyer. His mother liked to take him to see local theatrical productions. Hoffman was especially moved by the play All My Sons, which he saw when he was 12. "When I saw All My Sons, I was changed—permanently changed—by that experience. It was like a miracle to me," he later told The New York Times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At first, Hoffman was more interested in athletics than acting. But he turned to theater after he was sidelined by a wrestling injury in his teens. At the age of 17, Hoffman was accepted into the New York State Summer School of the Arts. He continued to study acting at New York University.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Acting Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1992, Hoffman landed one of his first major film roles in Scent of a Woman, starring opposite Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell. His career began to take off, and he landed a number of supporting or character parts in such films as Nobody's Fool (1994) with Paul Newman, Twister (1996) with Bill Paxton and Boogie Nights (1997) with Julianne Moore. Hoffman worked with a variety of directors, from Ethan and Joel Coen on The Big Lebowski (1998) to Todd Solondz on Happiness (1998).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With his ability to be convincing in nearly any part, Hoffman played a snide, upper-crust bully in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), starring Jude Law and Matt Damon, and a male nurse to an ailing, eldery man (Jason Robards) in Magnolia (1999). The following year, he showed his versatility as a performer on the Broadway stage, appearing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West with John C. Reilly. The two actors switched parts every other night, and both received a Tony Award nomination for their work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2005, Hoffman had a career breakthrough with the film Capote, in which he played famed writer Truman Capote. The film takes place in the early 1960s, when Capote was working on his non-fiction best-seller In Cold Blood, about the 1959 killing of a Kansas family. Hoffman threw himself into the role, but only after some initial trepidation. "I knew that it would be great, but I still took the role kicking and screaming," Hoffman told The New York Times. "Playing Capote took a lot of concentration. I prepared for four and a half months. I read and listened to his voice and watched videos of him on TV." All of his hard work paid off. Hoffman earned widespread praise for his performance in the film, and took home the coveted Academy Award for best actor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following Capote, Hoffman received Academy Award nominations for supporting roles in Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and Doubt (2008). In Doubt, Hoffman starred opposite Meryl Streep as a priest who may or may not have had an inappropriate relationship with a young male student at a Catholic school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2012, Hoffman again proved himself as a lead actor. He starred in a revival of Death of a Salesman as Willy Loman, the patriarch in the dysfunctional family drama. Hoffman earned raves for his work, including a Tony Award nomination. That same year, he starred in The Master, playing a leader of a quasi-religious organization.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hoffman later landed a part in the second installment of The Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire (2013), as games designer Plutarch Heavensbee, co-starring with Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his personal life, Philip Seymour Hoffman struggled with drug and alchohol addiction. In 2013, he checked into a drug rehabilitation program for 10 days. Hoffman was found dead on February 2, 2014, at an apartment that he was renting as an office in New York City's Greenwich Village. The 46-year-old actor was found dead by a worried friend, according to police.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Weeks after his death, it was revealed that Hoffman died of an acute mixed drug intoxication, which included heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and amphetamine, in what was considered an accident according to the New York medical examiner's office. He was survived by longtime partner, costume designer Mimi O'Donnell, with whom he had three children—son Cooper and daughters Tallulah and Willa.</p><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Philip Seymour Hoffman</li><li>Birth Year: 1967</li><li>Birth date: July 23, 1967</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: Rochester</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Philip Seymour Hoffman was an American actor and director known for films such as Capote and Doubt.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Theater and Dance</li><li>Action</li><li>Drama</li><li>Comedy</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>New York State Summer School of the Arts</li><li>New York University</li></ul><li>Occupations</li><li>Death Year: 2014</li><li>Death date: February 2, 2014</li><li>Death State: New York</li><li>Death City: New York</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=31><ul data-node-id=33 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Philip Seymour Hoffman Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/philip-seymour-hoffman</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: August 16, 2019</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=36 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I try to live my life in such a way that I don't have profound regrets.
