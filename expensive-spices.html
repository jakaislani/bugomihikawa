We have just the thing for you. Below is a list of the top ten most costly spices in the world, as determined by worldwide markets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>List of 10 Most Expensive Spices in the World?</h2><p><strong>1. Saffron</strong> – <strong>$5,000 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18211311/Saffron.jpg><p>Saffron is a spice obtained from the stigma of the Crocus sativus flower, which grows across Eurasia. It is highly valued for its delicate floral flavor and is widely used in traditional Middle Eastern, Indian, and Western European cuisines.</p><p>But it’s not just the appetizing flavor notes that make it the most expensive spice in the world. It’s the way it’s made.</p><p>Saffron is one of the most time-consuming and labor-intensive botanicals known to man. A single kilo of saffron necessitates the collection of around a quarter-million blooms and 500-600 hours of hard labor.</p><p>To make matters more difficult, saffron flowers only bloom twice a year, and each blossom produces just three stigmas (the threadlike threads from which the entire spice is formed). the means there is a very short time frame in which all of the job must be completed.</p><p>Given these facts, it’s simple to see why so much of the cost is passed on to the consumer.</p><p><strong>2. Fennel Pollen</strong> – <strong>$500 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18211437/Fennel-Pollen.jpg><p>If you prefer Italian sausage or Indian food, you’ve probably had fennel before, but we’re almost certain you’ve never had it like this. From the bulbs to the seeds, nearly every element of the fennel plant (Foeniculum vulgare for all you horticultural nerds out there) is employed in some capacity in pan-cultural cooking.</p><p>The small blooms, or “pollen,” on the other hand, provide the most strong and nuanced flavors. These flowers aren’t cheap, which explains why the price tag is so high.</p><p>Fennel pollen is another spice that is expensive since it is difficult to collect in large amounts. Fortunately, a small amount goes a long way. It would have to, given that a single ounce costs a stunning $30.</p><p><strong>3. Pure Vanilla</strong> – <strong>$300 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18211807/Pure-Vanilla-1.jpg><p>The great majority of “vanilla” found in products such as sweets, cookies, and ice cream is a poor fake. Even so-called vanilla extracts, which masquerade as unadulterated vanilla essence, are sometimes made out of synthetic vanillin, the chemical element that gives true vanilla its distinct flavour.</p><p>Because the toothsome bean pods must be pollinated by hand and tended to almost constantly, the real McCoy can cost upwards of $20 per ounce. Bottom line, if you want premium vanilla (and trust us, you do), you must be willing to spend a premium.</p><p><strong>4. Mahleb</strong> – <strong>$80 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18211912/Mahleb-may-not-have-caught-on-yet-in-the-West-1.jpg><p>Mahleb may not be popular in the West yet, but it’s been a popular item among European and Arabian spice dealers for ages, and its appeal doesn’t appear to be waning anytime soon—even mediocre mahleb may sell for as much as $5-6 per ounce.</p><p>When you learn how it’s made, you’ll understand why.</p><p>Mahleb (also spelt “mahlab” and “mahalepi”) is a sweet, aromatic, slightly bitter spice made from the fruit stones of the Prunus mahaleb tree, also known as the St. Lucie cherry, a kind of cherry tree native to central and southern Europe, Asia, and select areas of the Near East.</p><p>Spice manufacturers must remove, dry, and grind hundreds of thousands of pits at a time to reduce entire cherries to fine dust appropriate for sprinkling. All you have to do is pay a few dollars. It appears to be a fair bargain.</p><p><strong>5. Long Pepper</strong> – <strong>$45 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18212043/Long-Pepper.jpg><p>Long pepper is identical to the ordinary black pepper you keep in the cupboard, except more complex in flavour and a lot more expensive.</p><p>One of the reasons for this spice’s high market value is that it has a “long” flavour profile. The dried, crushed berries include hints of anise, cinnamon, and nutmeg in addition to the traditional muskiness and sting of black pepper.</p><p>It’s also quite scarce. Long pepper comes in only two types, none of which is found outside of India and Indonesia. However, the pungent, woody pods have been known to appear at Indian supermarkets in remote locations, so keep an eye on the shelves and wait until after payday to stop in.</p><p><strong>6. Black Cumin Seed – $40 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18212227/Black-Cumin-Seed-1.jpg><p>Black cumin, a close cousin of ordinary cumin (Cuminum cyminum), has some slight differences in appearance and culinary application.</p><p>For starters, the seeds are smaller, thinner, and darker in colour. They’re sweeter and brighter in flavour, with a zesty tang on the back end. These palate-pleasing characteristics make them an excellent accompaniment to a variety of recipes, particularly those heavy on meat.</p><p>They are not, however, inexpensive. Black cumin seed is around $30 more expensive per pound than normal cumin. We’ll leave it to you to judge whether such a large difference is worthwhile.</p><p><strong>7. Kaffir Lime Leaves – $35 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18212328/Kaffir-Lime-Leaves.jpg><p>This well called herb is, as you might expect, the leaves of the Kaffir lime (also known as the “makrut lime”), a variety of citrus that grows abundantly in tropical Southeast Asia.</p><p>Kaffir lime leaves are hand-picked from a tangle of thorn-covered branches when they reach maturity, then dried and used to add a burst of sweet, vibrant citrus flavour to a variety of foods (notable examples include Thai Panang curry, Vietnamese ga nuong la chanh, and Indonesian soto ayam).</p><p>Needless to say, the meticulous harvesting process and unrivalled zestiness of the leaves result in a bundle of green that tends to go for, well, a bundle of green.</p><p><strong>8. Grains of Paradise</strong> – <strong>$32 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18212447/Green-Cardamom-1.jpg><p>If you guessed that a spice with a name like “Grains of Paradise” would be expensive, you’d be correct. Several variables contribute to this.</p><p>Grains of Paradise (also known as alligator pepper, Roman pepper, melegueta pepper, and Guinea grains) is a delightful spice that is typically characterised as a cross between black pepper, ginger, and cardamom. Furthermore, its growth necessitates endless hours of arduous labour on Africa’s scorching west coast.</p><p>Last but not least, the raw seeds have a lengthy history of therapeutic use on the African continent, having been prescribed to cure everything from low sex drive to dyspepsia at one point or another.</p><p><strong>9. Green Cardamom – <b>$30 Per Pound</b></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18212552/Green-Cardamom.jpg><p>Cardamom is one of the main ingredients of garam masala, the famed spice blend that gives Indian and Thai curries their characteristic strength. If you grew up in Sweden, Finland, or Norway, you might recognise its earthy, aromatic warmth from festive confections like julekake.</p><p>What you probably don’t realise is how expensive it is. If you decide to pick some up yourself, that will alter.</p><p>Currently, most spice dealers charge $30 per pound for entire green cardamom seeds, or around $2 per ounce. If those prices don’t make you enjoy your next chai latte a bit more, we don’t know what would.</p><p><strong>10. Pasilla de Oaxaca Chiles – $29 Per Pound</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/18212649/Pasilla-de-Oaxaca-Chiles-1.jpg><p>The Pasilla de Oaxaca chile, so named because it only grows in the isolated highland reaches of Oaxaca, Mexico, completes our list. This fertile junction of the Sierra Madre mountain range is famous for producing an endless supply of grade-A chili peppers, and the Pasilla de Oaxaca is no exception.</p><p>It has a medium-high level of heat and a distinct smokiness, just like many of the chiles from the region. Along with these guarantees, it provides a level of flavor that few other chilies can equal.</p><p>It’s no surprise, then, that Pasilla de Oaxaca is difficult to find for less than $30 per pound. That may appear to be a lot of money, but if you know how to utilize them effectively, it will most likely be 30 of the greatest dollars you’ve ever spent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp6vqZ2eqLa3sYysp6Kblah8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexpensive-spices.html&text=Here%20Are%20The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Spices%20in%20the%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexpensive-spices.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexpensive-spices.html&title=Here%20Are%20The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Spices%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexpensive-spices.html&title=Here%20Are%20The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Spices%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexpensive-spices.html&title=Here%20Are%20The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Spices%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexpensive-spices.html&description=Here%20Are%20The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Spices%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paul-mccartney-drew-some-inspiration-from-the-beatles-for-his-band-on-the-run-cover.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paul McCartney Drew Some Inspiration From The Beatles For His Band On The Run Cover">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./david-beador-child-wife-lesley-cook-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Beador Welcomes First Child With Wife Lesley Cook">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
