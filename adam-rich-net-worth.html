The young actor became known for his pageboy haircut, which inspired parents across the country to style their own sons’ hair in a similar fashion. Rich’s charming on-screen persona earned him the nickname “America’s little brother.” Despite its initial success, “Eight is Enough” was cancelled after five seasons and 112 episodes due to declining ratings.
