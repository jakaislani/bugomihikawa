In 1987, he co-founded the jazz/hip-hop group the Roots, which garnered critical and commercial acclaim before becoming the house band for Late Night With Jimmy Fallon in 2009. Questlove is also a music history professor, a best-selling author and the Academy Award-winning director of the 2021 documentary <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859821/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Summer of Soul" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Summer of Soul</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Questlove was born Ahmir Khalib Thompson on January 20, 1971, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Lee Andrews, had enjoyed commercial success in the late 1950s with his doo-wop band, the Hearts, and his mother, Jaquelin, was a model and a singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Raised in West Philadelphia, Questlove began drumming at age two and<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/magazine/questlove-summer-of-soul.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" developed a fascination" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> developed a fascination</a> with music shows like Soul Train. Around that time, a wave of '50s nostalgia had revived his father's career, and Questlove soon began spending school vacations on the road with his parents and older sister, Donn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By age seven, the budding musician was preparing his father's performance outfits, and within two years, he was<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/12/the-rhythm-in-everything data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" in charge of stage lighting" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> in charge of stage lighting</a>. At age 12, Questlove filled in when the band's drummer canceled and debuted alongside his father at New York City's Radio City Music Hall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Questlove entered the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, which counted the future members of Boyz II Men and rising jazz luminaries Christian McBride and Joey DeFrancesco among its student body. It also included a streetwise art student named Tariq Trotter, who found in Questlove's drum beats a strong backing to his freestyle rapping abilities.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career with The Roots</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1987, the duo<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/roots data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" launched the hip-hop group" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> launched the hip-hop group</a> that became The Roots. Alongside Questlove (also known as ?uestlove) and Trotter, a.k.a Black Thought, The Roots expanded to include lyricist Malik B., Josh Abrams and then Leonard Hubbard on bass, and Scott Storch on keyboard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Delivering socially conscious lyrics and jazz-influenced sound from its instrumentalists, The Roots were an anomaly in a genre of sampled beats and a "gangsta" ethos defined by artists like Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. With a limited market for their unique sound, they independently released a debut album, Organix (1993) and spent much of the early 1990s touring Europe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Questlove eventually developed a machine-like quality to his drumming, and with it arrived The Roots' first taste of commercial success. Their third album,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://albumism.com/features/the-roots-illadelph-halflife-turns-25-anniversary-retrospective data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Illadelph Halflife" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> Illadelph Halflife</a> (1996), spawned a breakout single in "Clones" and an attention-grabbing video for "What They Do." Their follow-up effort,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22132-things-fall-apart/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Things Fall Apart" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> Things Fall Apart</a> (1999), brought the group's first gold record and Grammy win, for the single "You Got Me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With Questlove and Black Thought providing the backbone to a fluctuating lineup, The Roots continued mesmerizing fans with albums like Phrenology (2002), Game Theory (2006), How I Got Over (2010) and Undun (2011). They also teamed up with Jay-Z for the hip-hop mogul's MTV Unplugged performance in 2001, and with John Legend, for the Grammy-winning cover album Wake Up! in 2010.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Soulquarians and Other Music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the late 1990s, Questlove branched out from the Roots to collaborate with other jazz- and soul-influenced artists. Their collective, which became known as the<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.okayplayer.com/originals/best-soulquarians-songs-playlist-the-roots-j-dilla-erykah-badu.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Soulquarians" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> Soulquarians</a>, was prominently involved in the production of acclaimed albums like Mos Def's Black on Both Sides (1999), D'Angelo's Voodoo (2000) and Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Questlove also served as the musical director for Chappelle's Show in the early 2000s and executive music producer for projects like the 2014 Chris Rock film Top Five. Additionally, he has carved out a prominent side career as a DJ, which provides the opportunity to play favorites from his deep<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/arts/music/questlove-favorite-things.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" collection" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> collection</a> of at least 170,000 records.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Jimmy Fallon's House Band</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2009, The Roots embarked on a new career path as the house band for Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. According to Questlove, they initially faced scrutiny from producers who<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.democracynow.org/2013/8/14/questlove_on_his_musical_upbringing_hip data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" doubted the group’s musical range" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> doubted the group’s musical range</a>, until they displayed a skill for toggling between genres with their "Freestylin' with the Roots" segment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Questlove has also spoken of how he was<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.salon.com/2013/06/22/questlove_michele_bachmann_almost_got_me_fired_from_jimmy_fallon_show/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" nearly fired" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> nearly fired</a> for playing Wishbone's "Lyin' Ass Bitch" during conservative Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann's introduction to the show in 2011. The drummer eventually put the controversy behind him, thanks to the repartee he showed with Late Night's host and guests, and he was promoted to musical director when Fallon took over The Tonight Show in 2014.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Summer of Soul' and Other Screen Credits</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Presented with more than 40 hours of<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/summer-soul-movie-hulu-questlove-black-woodstock.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" little-seen footage" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> little-seen footage</a> from the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, Questlove sorted through the captivating performances of acts like Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Mahalia Jackson and Sly and the Family Stone and obtained interviews with both artists and fans who were in attendance.
