While they were dating, they used to post videos and photographs of them together on social media. However, they called it quits pretty soon and initially said that they had separated on amicable terms.</span></p><p><span>Contrary evidence to their ‘amicable split’ surfaced when a video of both of them fighting started trending on social media. In that video, they were reportedly fighting over Elle’s juul. Elle was heard telling Hall to hit her, while Hall kept refusing. While they initially denied that it was them in the video, later both of them confirmed the same. Here is the video:</span></p><p>Bryce Hall & Elle Danjean fight leaked that resulted in a breakup!</p>Bryce Hall & Elle Danjean fight leaked that resulted in a breakup! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://t.co/U9MZmJXLe2</a><p><span>The point of contention for the fight was that apparently, Bryce had received several death threats from people who knew Elle personally. Bryce was apprehensive and “pissed” over the fact that Elle had given his number to people whom he didn’t know, without his consent.</span></p><p><span>Elle was more concerned about the fact that the video got leaked on social media, and seemingly apologized for her behavior on video. As of 2022, they no longer speak to each other or follow each other on social media, and have deleted most photos and videos of them together, on social media.</span></p><h3 id=who-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend-5><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Addison Rae</a></span></h3><figure class=image contenteditable=false>(Source: Instagram)</figure><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Addison</a> Rae and Bryce Hall had famously dated between 2019 and early 2021, and during this period they were in an on-and-off relationship. They were also considered the “power couple” of TikTok.</span></p><p><span>During the fall season of 2019, Addison and Bryce were first linked together, since they created TikTokers together quite often and hung out as well, despite belonging to two different TikTok collectives.</span></p><p><span>Then, on January 1, 2020, this picture of them kissing was posted on Instagram:</span></p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>(Source: Instagram)</figure><p><span>This was followed by months of them affirming on social media their relationship status cryptically, and giving hints but not telling the whole truth.</span></p><p><span>They were thought to be dating in the earlier months of 2020, but by August that year, they had reportedly split up. In October 2020, they seemed to have reconciled and got back together. They also went to a Halloween party together and in November 2020, they posted a video of them together, seemingly revealing things about their relationship:</span></p><p><span>They continued to date until March 2021, when allegations of Bryce cheating on Addison surfaced. He responded by defying the claims while Addison did not say anything confirming the same, posting ambiguous tweets and asking fans for privacy. By late March, they had separated with finality, to focus on their careers.</span></p><p><span>In May 2021, Addison and her ‘He’s All That’ co-star Tanner Buchanan appeared to kiss on stage at the MTV Movie & TV Awards.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, they are not on speaking terms and do not follow each other on any social media platform. However, they do not shy away from mentioning each other’s names in YouTube videos of theirs.</span></p><h3 id=who-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend-6><span>Riley Hubatka</span></h3><p><span>Hall has been linked with a few other people like Riley Hubatka, and the two were apparently caught kissing in paparazzi footage in 2021. Apparently, sometime in 2022, Hall had proposed to Riley to be his girlfriend, and Riley refused the offer. He later made a video on his channel confronting Riley about rejecting him.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b7%2FPqKmtq5uasqWtjZympmeknri1u8porqGnXZ7Abq7RspqeZZiWua15xqKppZ6inrKvsA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend.html&text=Who%20is%20Bryce%20Hall%27s%20girlfriend%20currently%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Bryce%20Hall%27s%20girlfriend%20currently%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Bryce%20Hall%27s%20girlfriend%20currently%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Bryce%20Hall%27s%20girlfriend%20currently%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-bryce-hall-girlfriend.html&description=Who%20is%20Bryce%20Hall%27s%20girlfriend%20currently%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billy-grahams-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billy Grahams biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tony-zenet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Zenet  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
