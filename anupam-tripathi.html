His father wanted him to stay in India, study, get a job, and earn. However, after he gained the scholarship, his parents agreed to let him go. After coming to South Korea in 2010, he faced several difficulties due to differences in culture, food, and language. He was still able to learn Korean in two years.</li></ul><ul><li>In a past interview, he expressed his concerns over being stereotyped as he had only played migrant workers in South Korean films and television dramas. He said,<br><p>Now, I am an expert foreign worker. Although it was never intended, 90% of the roles given were all ‘migrant workers. It seems that the stage where a foreign actor like me can stand in Korea is limited. But even in the same station, we try to transform the character. Sometimes I become a hard-working worker, and sometimes I try to be a smart worker. Although it is a small role, I try to be different from others by changing the way I speak, hairstyle, and gestures. Because I am a foreigner, there are limits to my language as well. However, it was difficult in the past to wait, but now it is not difficult. I can afford it. I think it’s time to learn. I want to stop working as a worker and do melodrama.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>While talking about his popularity and role in ‘Squid Game’ to the Variety, Tripathi said,<br><p>We felt that it will be received well, but when it became a phenomenon and sensation, it was not expected – I was not prepared. I still remember, September 17, 2021, 4 p.m., my life was OK, but after 5 p.m., it became huge, humongous — suddenly everyone was messaging me and it was ‘Ali,’ ‘Ali’,”</p></li></ul><ul><li>For his role of ‘Ali’ in ‘Squid Game,’ he had to gain weight, and one of his friends helped him achieve that. In an interview, he said,<br><p>At that time I didn’t have the correct body shape because I had just come back after eating home food, and once they said, ‘OK you are doing this character,’ I was like OK now I have to put on weight, I have to work for it. I gained 5 or 6 kilograms and at least looked like somebody who has some power.”</p><p>In the same interview, he told that he watched BBC documentaries on Pakistani migrants and spent time with Pakistani friends in South Korea to play Ali.</p><p>I tried to go as close as I could to the character. I kept on thinking it’s going to be released in 190 countries, so how can I connect with the audience as a character. That was my internal quest all the way the day from the day they said yes to me to the day it ended. “</p></li></ul><ul><li>He drinks alcohol occasionally. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm
