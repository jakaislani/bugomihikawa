Now they raise their three children — son James Wilkie, born in 2002, and twins Tabitha and Marion, born in 2009 — in New York City’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/1014495/maramovies/matthew-broderick-and-sarah-jessica-parker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Greenwich Village" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Greenwich Village</a>, with the firm belief that their fame and status can’t get in the way of their family life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I love Matthew Broderick,” Parker told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a1003/sarah-jessica-parker-interview-0913 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper’s Bazaar" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2013 of her husband. “Call me crazy, but I love him. We can only be in the marriage we are. We're very devoted to our family and our lives. I love our life. I love that he’s the father of my children, and it’s because of him that there’s this whole other world that I love.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That commitment to each other — and to their children — has kept their relationship tight for the last 20-plus years. But when asked what the secret is, Broderick joked on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxvnpN-pZHw&feature=youtu.be" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SiriusXM’s Radio Andy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">SiriusXM’s Radio Andy</a> in November 2020, “I don’t know. I keep reading communication and she’s my best friend — any cliché you want!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But he quickly clarified, “You want a little more romance and grit… than just your best pal,” before declaring, “I don't know the secret at all, but I'm very grateful and I love her and it's amazing.”</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Before Broderick, Parker dated Robert Downey Jr. and John F. Kennedy Jr.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even before they met, Broderick made an impression on Parker. She clearly remembers watching his film War Games in 1983 while she was filming Footloose, seeing a screening of 1985’s Ladyhawke with an agent, and catching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off with her pal, actress Martha Plimpton, at a theater in New York City’s Columbus Circle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It’s not like I had my sights set on him, but I was aware of him as an actor because I liked his work so much,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/1014495/maramovies/matthew-broderick-and-sarah-jessica-parker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Parade class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Parade</a>. He also recalled seeing her in 1991’s L.A. Story, and “thinking she was wonderful, hilarious and beautiful,” he told the magazine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both established in the industry, they had their share of high-profile romances. Parker dated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-downey-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Downey, Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Downey, Jr.</a>, for seven years, after they <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instyle.com/news/tbt-sarah-jessica-parker-robert-downey-jr-relationship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="met on the set" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">met on the set</a> of 1984’s Firstborn when they were both 18.

You know, ‘Hi, it’s Matthew Broderick,'’’ she said, then directing to him, “You had to use your last name.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1996, they mixed business with pleasure when Parker <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/1014495/maramovies/matthew-broderick-and-sarah-jessica-parker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="joined the cast" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">joined the cast</a> of the Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He had already been in the lead role of J.

But he also added, “I think she's great in the part...I guess if I didn't, that would be awkward."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By that point, they were also living together. “The last 48 hours or so, Matthew has had this running joke about us, we work together, we eat together, we sleep together, we wake up together, we work together, we eat together, we sleep together,” Parker <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/garden/at-home-with-sarah-jessica-parker-and-matthew-broderick-too-cute-for-words.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. “It occurred to me that that was a dangerous part of this, that our world would become very small. There was always something nice about sharing your experiences. Now, all of a sudden our experiences are the same, and I don't feel like I'm bringing a lot to the table.”</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">One of their parties turned into their surprise wedding</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having survived working and living together, the couple moved on to the next phase of their lives. “Matthew and I come from a different time and place,” Parker told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a1003/sarah-jessica-parker-interview-0913 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper’s Bazaar" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harper’s Bazaar</a>. “When we were young people, all we ever wanted was to be good working actors. We didn't think of fame or money because, honestly, money was never part of the dream. It was to work in theater, to be around those people whose work I was in total awe of. I never saw the trappings; nobody talked about being a celebrity.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Of course fame did come into the picture, especially when they decided to wed. “When our marriage came up in conversation, it wouldn't occur to us that we were obligated to respond to allegations or gossip,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a1003/sarah-jessica-parker-interview-0913 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a>. “You have to be a bit circumspect, but you also have to take up a position, and you have to stick to it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So they handled it in a way they knew best. They invited 100 friends for a party on May 19, 1997, which instead turned out to be their surprise wedding. Just to ensure there was nothing traditional, Parker wore a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-20-year-marriage-matthew-broderick-raising-kids/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="black wedding dress" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">black wedding dress</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They've faced many false claims about their marriage but keep a united front</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both actors’ careers continued to thrive, as Parker became known for Sex and the City and Broderick continued with headline roles on stage and screen, most notably in the 1999’s Election and Broadway’s The Producers, which then became a 2005 film. With that lurked the public’s interest in their personal lives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the eve of their 20th anniversary, Parker was tired of shooting down rumors and took to Instagram, posting a screenshot of fact-checking inquiry she received from The National Enquirer, attempting to plant trouble in their marriage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Over a decade of the same untrue, disgraceful nonsense,” she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/BxgjGLEg_i8/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Instagram class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Instagram</a> in May 2019. “As usual, days ahead of our anniversary on May 19th, The National Enquirer is making its annual best effort to fabricate and undermine, this time a blissful 4 days with my husband in London.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As proof of just how tight their union is, Broderick and Parker teamed up again for the stage in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/neil-simon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Simon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Neil Simon</a> play Plaza Suite, in which they play three couples at different stages of their relationships, but all in the same suite.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Parker posted that she would get to work with “an actor whom I get to love onstage and off” as the two actors played the six roles. “I feel I’ve waited a lifetime,” she posted on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2O8trAl5_N/?utm_source=ig_embed" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Instagram class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Instagram</a> of the 17-week run on Broadway, originally scheduled for 2020. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic paused the show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the pandemic did give them time to reflect on the experience of working together on the play. “I was just reminded of how funny and smart and what a great comic actor she is, or actor, never mind the comic part… She's very good at it…. I hope everybody gets to see her do it," Broderick said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxvnpN-pZHw&feature=youtu.be" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SiriusXM’s Radio Andy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">SiriusXM’s Radio Andy</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The couple's biggest focus is their children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite their successes, separate and together, it ultimately comes down to their kids.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“We always feel that as long as one parent is home and really present, then we can care for our children’s desires,” Parker told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/1014495/maramovies/matthew-broderick-and-sarah-jessica-parker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Parade class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Parade</a>. “We go as a family on the subway; we walk; we do everything we want to do.
